To adapt it to your needs, you have to modify all the occurrences in the files AND in the names of files <strong>in the respect of the case</strong> :
<br />
Module name to replace : <ul class="formatter-ul"><li class="formatter-li">Modcat</li><li class="formatter-li">modcat</li></ul>
Class name to replace : <ul class="formatter-ul"><li class="formatter-li">Itemcat</li><li class="formatter-li">itemcat</li></ul>
<br />
Take care of your name choice for obviously reasons of compatibility with php methods or functions of the phpboost core or with allready installed modules, or with css/html class and properties : class, item, clone, event ... . Make a global search on your name before processing.
<br />
<br />
This module offers a presentation by categories, displaying the list of top-level categories on its home page. You will also find many features you can use, modify, or delete to suit your needs (categories, contribution, comments, number of views, and so on...).
<br />
Enjoy.';
